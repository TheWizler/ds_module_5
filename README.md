Utilized pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to generate summarized descriptions, and visualizations of datasets.


Analysis
The sex Distribution of Mice seems fairly equal with males at 50.6 %, and females at 46.4% suggesting equal representation in the study. However, I did notice slight fluctuations in the data, suggesting that male mice might respond slightly better to Capomulin, while female mice might respond slightly better to Ramicane as indicated by the the lower mean and median tumor volumes.

Most effective treatment: After viewing the summary statistics, I gathered that Ramicane appears to be the most effective treatment.

However, there are outliers in Capomulin and Ramicane that may be bringing the avg mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM down causing the treatment to appear more effective. Contrarily, there are also outliers in Infubinol and Ceftamin that may be increasing the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM the treatment to appear less effective.

The correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume when utilizing Capomulin is positive, indicating that heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes on average. This means that weightcouldy influene the growth ofg tumos.

Viewing the data from our line chart, Capomulin appears to be highly effective and tumor volume significantly drops around the 25 Time Point period..
